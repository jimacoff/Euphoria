# :fire: Euphoria - A Mobile First Digital Banking Experience :fire: 

Inspired by the wave of Neobanks arriving in Australia (Upbank, Archa, Xinja, 86400 and Volt), I wanted to craft my own  interpretation of what a digital banking experience should look like. 

One of the major issues with banking apps is that they generally don't allow for a memorable **social invoicing** (paying your friends, essentially) experience. Whereas apps such as *BeemIt*, which does social invoicing extremely well, doesn't allow you to track your expenses and do normal "bank things". In a nutshell, there isn't a banking app that allows you to bank and pay your friends easily.

Euphoria is a concept project to unify a memorable **social invoicing** experience and traditional banking features all under the same app.

- The social invoicing feature was highly inspired by the app **BeemIt**, it is available for Australian banking users only.  Their rich set of social invoicing features such as pay/request/split has proven to be a lifesaver for me and my friends (https://www.beemit.com.au/).

- Other areas of the app that highly inspired the navigations and general feel of the app are Upbank (https://up.com.au/), Xinja (https://xinja.com.au/) and Volt Bank (https://www.voltbank.com.au/).
